# Sign-Up Form

This project is part of the Intermediate HTML & CSS course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal is to learn how to effectively structure and style form elements. 

My objective was to replicate the design of the provided Sign-Up Form, as shown in this [reference image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png).
